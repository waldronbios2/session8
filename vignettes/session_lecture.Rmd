# Review

## Cox proportional hazards model

* Cox proportional hazard regression assesses the relationship between a right-censored, time-to-event outcome and multiple predictors:
    + categorical variables (e.g., treatment groups)
    + continuous variables

$$
log(HR(x_i)) = log \frac{h(t|x_i)}{h_0(t)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + ... + \beta_p x_{pi}
$$

* $HR(x_i)$ is the hazard of patient $i$ relative to baseline
* $h(t|x_i)$ is the time-dependent hazard function $h(t)$ for patient $i$
* $h_0(t)$ is the *baseline hazard function*, and is the negative of the slope of the $S_0(t)$, the baseline _survival_ function.

* Multiplicative model

## Caveats and Assumptions

* Categories with no events
    + can occur when the group is small or its risk is low
    + HRs with respect to such a reference group are infinite
    + hypothesis tests and CIs are difficult / impossible to interpret

* Assumptions of Cox PH model
    + Constant hazard ratio over time (proportional hazards)
    + Linear association between log(HR) and predictors (log-linearity) / multiplicative relationship between hazard and predictors
    + Independence of survival times between individuals in the sample

# Checking assumptions of Cox model

## Residuals analysis

* Residuals are used to investigate the lack of fit of a model to a given subject. 
* For Cox regression, thereâ€™s no easy analog to the usual "observed minus predicted" residual

\footnotesize
```{r}
library(pensim); set.seed(1)
mydat <- create.data(nvars=c(1, 1), nsamples=500, 
    cors=c(0, 0), associations=c(0.5, 0.5), 
    firstonly=c(TRUE, TRUE), censoring=c(0, 8.5))$data
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
## Rename variables of simulated data, and make one variable categorical.
colnames(mydat)[1:2] <- c("Var1", "Var2")
mydat$Var1 <- cut(mydat$Var1, breaks=2, labels=c("low", "high"))
mydat$time <- ceiling(mydat$time*1000)
```

## Simulated data to test residuals methods

\footnotesize

```{r}
summary(mydat)
```

## Kaplan-Meier plot of simulated data, stratified by Var1

```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Do Kaplan-Meier plot
par(cex=1.5)
library(survival)
library(survminer)
kmfit <- survfit(Surv(time, cens)~Var1, data=mydat)
ggsurvplot(kmfit, risk.table = TRUE, linetype=1:2)
```

## Martingale residuals

* censoring variable $c_i$ (1 if event, 0 if censored) minus the estimated cumulative hazard function $H(t_i, X_i, \beta_i)$ (1 - survival function)
    + E.g., for a subject censored at 1 year ($c_i=0$), whose predicted cumulative hazard at 1 year was 30\%, Martingale = $0 - 0.30 = -0.30$.
    + E.g. for a subject who had an event at 6 months, and whose predicted cumulative hazard at 6 months was 80%, Margingale = $1 - 0.8 = 0.2$.

* Problem: not symmetrically distributed, even when model fits the data well

## Martingale residuals in simulated data
```{r, echo=FALSE}
fitsim <- coxph(Surv(time, cens) ~ Var1 + Var2, data=mydat)
par(cex=1.5)
plot(mydat$time, resid(fitsim),
     xlab="Time", ylab="Martingale Residuals")
abline(h=0, lty=2)
lines(lowess(mydat$time, resid(fitsim)), col='red')
```

## Deviance residuals in simulated data

* Deviance residuals are scaled Martingale residuals
* Should be more symmetrically distributed about zero?
* Observations with large deviance residuals are poorly predicted by the model
```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(cex=1.5)
plot(mydat$time, resid(fitsim, type="deviance"),
     xlab="Time", ylab="Deviance Residuals")
abline(h=0, lty=2)
lines(lowess(mydat$time, resid(fitsim)),col='red')
```

## Schoenfeld residuals

* technical definition: contribution of a covariate at each event time to the partial derivative of the log-likelihood
* intuitive interpretation: the observed minus the expected values of the covariates at each event time.
* a random (unsystematic) pattern across event times gives evidence the covariate effect is not changing with respect to time
* If it is systematic, it suggests that as time passes, the covariate effect is changing.

## Schoenfeld residuals for simulated data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fitzph <- cox.zph(fitsim)
par(mfrow=c(1,2), cex=1.5)
plot(fitzph, var=1)
plot(fitzph, var=2)
```

## Schoenfeld test for proportional hazards

* Tests correlation between scaled Schoenfeld residuals and time
* Equivalent to fitting a simple linear regression model with time as the predictor and residuals as the outcome
* Parametric analog of smoothing the residuals against time using LOWESS
* If the hazard ratio is constant, correlation should be zero.
    + Positive values of the correlation suggest that the log-hazard ratio increases with time.
```{r, echo=FALSE}

```


## The hazard function h(t), stratified by Var1

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(cex=1.5)
library(muhaz)
hazhigh = with(mydat[mydat$Var1=="high", ], muhaz(time, cens))
hazlow = with(mydat[mydat$Var1=="low", ], muhaz(time, cens))
plot(hazlow, lwd=2, ylim=c(0, 0.002), xlab="Follow-up time")
lines(hazhigh, lty=2, lwd=2, col="red")
legend("topleft", legend=c("Var1 = low", "Var1 = high"), lty=1:2, lwd=2, col=c("black", "red"), bty='n')
```

## Log-minus-log plot

* Used to check proportional hazards assumption

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kmfit <- survfit(Surv(time, cens) ~ Var1, data=mydat)
ggsurvplot(kmfit, fun="cloglog")
```

## Example: Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC)

* Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver conducted between 1974 and 1984, n=424 patients. 
* randomized placebo controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine.
    + 312 cases from RCT, plus additional 112 not from RCT.
* Primary outcome is (censored) time to death

## Kaplan-Meier plot of treatment and placebo arms

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Data cleaning
data(pbc)
library(dplyr)
pbc.os <- pbc %>%
  filter(complete.cases(time, status, trt)) %>%
  mutate(os = status==2) %>%
  mutate(arm = factor(trt, levels=2:1, labels=c("placebo", "treatment")),
         ascites = factor(ascites),
         hepato = factor(hepato),
         spiders = factor(spiders),
         edema = factor(edema),
         stage = factor(stage))
```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
##KM plot of PBC data
par(cex = 1.5)
library(survival)
fit <- survfit(Surv(time / 365, os) ~ arm, data = pbc.os)
survminer::ggsurvplot(fit)
survminer::ggsurvplot(fit, risk.table = TRUE, linetype = 1:2)
```


# Tests for trend

# What are tests for trend?

* For any kind of multivariate model including an ordinal variable
* Such as cancer stage (1, 2, 3, 4), age category, ...
    + Is there a linear / quadratic / cubic relationship between coefficients and their order?
    + Test by LRT or Wald Test

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(cex = 2)
## This is a manual way to plot the trend.
fit <- coxph(Surv(time, os) ~ stage, data = pbc.os)
stagecoefs <- c(0, coef(fit)[c("stage2", "stage3", "stage4")])
plot(
  x = 1:4,
  y = stagecoefs,
  type = "b",
  xlab = "Stages 2, 3, 4 (1=ref)",
  ylab = "Coefficient, ie ln(HR)",
  xlim = c(1, 4)
)
## In R, just define stage as an ordered factor and tests for trend are done automatically:
pbc.os <-
  mutate(pbc.os, stageordered = factor(stage, ordered = TRUE))
fit <- coxph(Surv(time, os) ~ stageordered, data = pbc.os)
summary(fit)  ##highly significant tests of overall fit by LRT, Wald, and logrank test.
```

# Predictions for specific covariate patterns

## How to predict survival from a Cox model?

* The Cox model is a _relative_ risk model
    + only predicts relative risks between pairs of subjects 
* Key is to calculate the overall $S(t)$, then multiply it by the relative hazard for the specific covariate pattern.
* In this example we plot the baseline survival for all stages together, then for stages 1-4 separately. 

## Predicted survival for specific covariate patterns

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(cex = 1.5)
fit <- coxph(Surv(time, os) ~ stage, data = pbc.os)
##HR for each stage, relative to overall
HR <- predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(stage = factor(1:4)))
plot(
  survfit(fit)$time,
  survfit(fit)$surv,
  type = "l",
  xlab = "Time (days)",
  ylab = "Survival Probability"
)
for (i in 1:4)
  lines(
    survfit(fit)$time,
    (survfit(fit)$surv) ^ exp(HR[i]),
    type = "l",
    col = i + 1,
    lty = i + 1
  )
legend(
  "bottomleft",
  legend = c("Overall", "Stage 1", "Stage 2", "Stage 3", "Stage 4"),
  col = 1:5,
  lty = 1:5,
  bty = "n"
)
```

## Multivariate regression

* Same coding and objectives as for `lm()` and `glm()`
    + controlling for confounding
    + testing for mediation
    + testing for interaction

##   

\tiny
```{r}
fit <- coxph(Surv(time, os) ~ age + sex + edema
             + stage + arm, data = pbc.os)
summary(fit)
```

## Predicted survival for adjusted coefficients

* Can create Kaplan-Meier curves for crude or unadjusted coefficients
    + Section 6.3.2.3 in Vittinghoff
* Idea is to estimate hazard ratio in an unadjusted model:

\footnotesize
```{r}
unadjfit <- coxph(Surv(time, os) ~ stage, data = pbc.os)
coef(unadjfit)
```

## Predicted survival for adjusted coefficients (cont'd)

* and in an adjusted model:

\footnotesize
```{r}
adjfit <- coxph(Surv(time, os) ~ age + sex + edema
                + stage + arm, data = pbc.os)
coef(adjfit)
```

## Predicted survival for adjusted coefficients (cont'd)

* The survival function will be calculated for a "baseline" group, say stage 1, then exponentiated with the adjusted coefficient, e.g.:
$$
[S_{stage=1}(t)]^{exp(\beta_{stage=4})}
$$

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(cex = 1.5)
basefit <- survfit(unadjfit, newdata = data.frame(stage = factor(1)))
plot(
  x = basefit$time,
  y = basefit$surv,
  type = "l",
  ylim = c(0, 1),
  xlab = "Time",
  ylab = "Survival Probability"
)
stage4unadj <- (basefit$surv) ^ (exp(coef(unadjfit)["stage4"]))
stage4adj <- (basefit$surv) ^ (exp(coef(adjfit)["stage4"]))
lines(
  x = basefit$time,
  y = stage4adj,
  col = "red",
  lty = 1,
  lw = 2
)
lines(
  x = basefit$time,
  y = stage4unadj,
  col = "blue",
  lty = 3
)
legend(
  "bottomleft",
  legend = c("Stage 1", "Stage 4 adjusted", "Stage 4 unadjusted"),
  col = c("black", "red", "blue"),
  lw = c(1, 2, 1),
  lty = c(1, 1, 3)
)
```

# Stratification

## What is stratification?

* relevant to all kinds of regression, not just survival analysis
* when analysis is separated into groups or strata
    + must have an adequate number of events in each stratum (at least 5 to 7)
    + can be used to adjust for variables with strong impact on survival
    + can help solve proportional hazards violations
    
* Strata have different baseline hazards
* Coefficients / Hazard Ratios are calculated within stratum then combined.

* Vittinghoff 6.3.2

## How to stratify

**Example - in R, strata() can be added to any model formula**
\footnotesize
```{r}
mycox <- coxph(Surv(time, os) ~ trt + strata(stage), 
               data = pbc.os)
summary(mycox)
```

# Competing Risks Data

## What are competing risks?

* Example from Vittinghoff 6.5: The MrOS study (Orwoll et al. 2005) followed men over 65 to examine predictors of bone fracture and low BMD (subclinical bone loss)
* At end of study participants had:
    + developed fracture (outcome of interest),
    + remained alive without fracture (incomplete follow-up), or
    + died prior to fracture (incomplete follow-up)

\tiny Orwoll, E. _et al._ (2005). Design and baseline characteristics of the osteoporotic fractures in men (MrOS) studyâ€“a large observational study of the determinants of fracture in older men. Contemporary Clinical Trials, 26(5), 569â€“585.

## Why not treat died prior to fracture and alive without fracture as censored?

* Recall the independent censoring assumption (Vittinghoff 6.6.4):
    + censored people are similar to those who remain at risk in terms of developing the event of interest;
    + censoring is independent of the event of interest.
    + For patients who died this assumption is highly suspect

## Reasons for right censored data

* Cut-off date of analysis (administrative censoring): 
    + Censoring usually independent
* Loss to follow-up
    + Independence may be problematic if sicker individuals discontinue participant in study (lack of energy, too ill, return to home country)
    + or if healthier individuals discontinue participation (don't feel the need to continue, start new life in other country)
* Competing risks: 
    + Often informative. 
    + In competing risks analysis, independence between competing risks is not required

## Very brief summary of competing risk methods

* 1-to-1 mapping between hazard and cumulative incidence function is lost in competing risks
* Standard Kaplan-Meier estimator is biased for competing risks data
    + Aalen-Johansen estimator is better choice
* _Gary's test_ is analogous to log-rank test
* cause-specific standard Cox PH model might be useful for prognostic (causal) testing, but not estimating a population Hazard Ratio

# Propensity score analysis

## What is propensity score analysis?

* an alternative to multivariate regression to control for hypothesized confounders in observational studies:

```
outcome ~ exposure + counfounder1 + confounder2
```

* a stratification approach that is more practical than stratifying on multiple hypothesized confounders
* an approach to summarizing many covariates into a single score
* a convenient approach to controlling for many hypothesized confounders

## Propensity score approach to correction for confounders

* *Step 1*: fit the propensity score model (no outcome) that predicts propensity for exposure based on confounders:
```
exposure ~ counfounder1 + confounder2
```

* *Step 2*: use propensity predictions to match or stratify participants with similar propensity (for example, stratifying on quintiles of propensity)

* *Step 3*: check adequacy of matching or stratification, ie by comparing attributes of matched participants 

* *Step 4*: test hypothesis _among matched participants_:
```
outcome ~ exposure
```
